1. Introduction
- Neo4j is one of the popular graph databases.
- It is open source.
Schema free
No SQL
- Written in Java.
- CQL stands for Cypher Query Language
Graph Databases are mainly useful to store more connected data.
Nowadays, most of the Social Networking applications like Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Twitter, Yammer etc. and Video hosting applications like Google YouTube, Flickr, Yahoo Video etc. are using more connected data.

2. Features :

- SQL Like easy query language Neo4j CQL
- It follows Property Graph Data Model
- It supports Indexes by using Apache Lucence
- It supports UNIQUE constraints
UI : Neo4j Data Browser
It supports full ACID(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) rules
It uses Native graph storage with Native GPE(Graph Processing Engine)
It supports exporting of query data to JSON and XLS format
It provides REST API to be accessed by any Programming Language like Java, Spring,Scala etc.
It provides Java Script to be accessed by any UI MVC Framework like Node JS.
It supports two kinds of Java API: Cypher API and Native Java API to develop Java applications

3. Advantages :

-It is very easy to represent connected data.
- It is very easy and faster to retrieve/traversal/navigation of more Connected data.
- Neo4j CQL is high level language
- It does NOT require complex Joins to retrieve connected/related data as it is very easy to retrieve it's adjacent node or relationship details without Joins or Indexes.

4. Limitations :

AS of Neo4j 2.1.3 latest version, it has a limitation of supporting number of Nodes, Relationships and Properties.
It does not support Sharding.

5. Property Graph Data Model :

- Represents data in Nodes, Relationships and Properties
- Both Nodes and Relationships contains properties
- Relationships connects nodes
- Properties are key-value pairs
- Nodes are represented using circle and Relationships are represented using arrow keys.
- Relationships have directions: Unidirectional and Bidirectional.

Cypher Query Language
It is a declarative pattern-matching language
It follows SQL like syntax.
Neo4j CQL supports many clauses like WHERE, ORDER BY etc., to write very complex queries in very easy manner.
Neo4j CQL supports some functions like String, Aggregation.In addition to them, it also supports some Relationship Functions.
